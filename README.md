# CombinerMod
80% done but not completed. Was mainly waiting on item models.

The idea was there would be an interactable on stage 5 that would take two items out of your inventory at random and combine them into a new more powerful item. One use per loop. I had almost all of the actual items finished, just needed to make the combiner. I stopped progress on the mod mainly because my modeler became busy. Might pick it back up in the future or donate to SS2 or cloudburst.
